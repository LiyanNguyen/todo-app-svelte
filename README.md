### My Process
- Design the Mobile viewport WHILE desinging the Desktop Viewport at the same time using
- Design the flex/grid system, making sure to have both Desktop and Mobile Viewport layout correct
- Add in all the other HTML content
- Finished up all the CSS designs
- Create the Svelte project
- Finish the App

### Built with
- Svelte framework
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned
- I initially did this in vanilla JS, realize it was not the most optimized thing and it can get complex the more features are added
- Did the project again in Svelte
